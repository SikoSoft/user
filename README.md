# user

A collection of front-end user interfaces, views and composed components that are built to work with the user API in [gapi](https://github.com/SikoSoft/gapi).

These components provide easier integration into the projects they are used by reducing the amount of front-end boiler plate needed to perform user related tasks.

At the moment, this library consists of little more than a login-form component, as the user system is relatively new and just now being developed.

In the coming weeks and months I expect to have added UI for role & user management.

## Tech

Like most of the other front-end code bases I actively maintain today, this project is built using Lit to create native web-components.

Some of the lower level (atom-like) components used here are imported from another [general purpose web-component library](https://github.com/SikoSoft/ui) that I maintain.
